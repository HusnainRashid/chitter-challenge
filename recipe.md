So that I can let people know what I am doing
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

- Posts link to post page with comments

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made
